# Judging Criteria
Teams will be judged on the following criteria. Judges will weigh each of the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

## Technology
How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did they use a particularly clever technique or did they use many different components?

## Design
Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it user-friendly or does it use a cool interface?).

## Viability
Has the project a realistic chance of being implemented by partners? Is the idea scalable and applicable to more industries? Is it realistic to further develop the project?

## Learning
Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.

## Originality
Is your project creative, new and innovative? Is it something we already know or is the idea disruptive?

## Wow-effect
Can you amaze the judges with new use-cases, big opportunities or surprises? How much did you achieve during the hackathon?

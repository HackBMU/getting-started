# Rules & Regulations
All teams must follow the rules mentioned below, failing to do so will lead to direct disqualification.

## Rules
- The teams may comprise of 1 - 4 members.
- Teams should be made up exclusively of students or recent graduates within 2 years of having graduation who are in no way related to organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event.
- A valid student ID card is required to attend the hackathon.
- Make sure you are upholding the hacker spirit by collaborating, sharing, helping beginners, and having fun.
- Collaborate, but bring your own ideas and code to the table. In essence, no plagiarism.
- All work on a hack should be done during the event. However, teams can use any idea they had before the event. Implementation from scratch is what we're gunning for. The idea itself need not to be "new" or "revolutionary".
- Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. However, it's against the spirit of a hackathon to work on a project before the event and open-source it later - it's not allowed.
- Teams can gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.
- Hacking stops when the time runs out. Though, minor fixes are allowed.
- Projects/Teams that break the Code of Conduct are strictly not allowed.
- Teams can be disqualified from the competition at organizers discretion. Reasons might include breaking the Competition Rules, Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.
- Prizes are subject to change without prior notice.
- All team members should be present at the event.
- Decision of the organizers in any matter will be final and binding.

## Demo
After hacking finishes, teams will be required to show their projects to the judges. You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches are discouraged, as you are judged on what you have built. You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren't able to finish. It's okay if you didn't finish your hack â€” that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well.

In case you don't have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.

## Remember!
The competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new, teach other people, and make new friends!
